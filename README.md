# Better-Career-Prediction
This project aims to provide better career and job suggestions to individuals using machine learning. The system is built
using Python, Machine Learning algorithms, HTML, and CSS. The machine learning algorithms analyze user's interests,
education, experience, and other factors to suggest the best career options. By combining the power of machine learning
with an intuitive user interface, we were able to create a tool that helps job seekers find better career matches and make
informed decisions about their future.
